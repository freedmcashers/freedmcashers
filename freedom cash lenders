Peer-to-peer (freedom cash lenders) lending, also known as social lending or crowdlending, is a method of financing that enables individuals to borrow from and lend money to each other directly.

With peer-to-peer lending, borrowers receive financing from individual investors who are willing to lend their own money for an agreed interest rate, perhaps via a peer-to-peer online platform. On these sites, investors can assess borrowers to determine whether to extend a loan.

A borrower may receive the full amount or only a portion of a loan, and it may be funded by one or more investors in the peer lending marketplace.  P2P lending service providers typically use technology to achieve cost advantages over traditional brick-and-mortar financial institutions, so can work with lower interest margins and may charge less interest on their loans.4 P2P loans represent an alternative source of financing, especially for borrowers who are unable to get approval from traditional sources.
