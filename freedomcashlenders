A credit union is a cooperative institution controlled by its members, usually those who are part of a particular group, organization, or community. Credit unions offer many of the same services as banks but may limit services to members only.

They are typically nonprofit enterprises, which enables them to lend money at more favorable rates or on more generous terms than commercial financial institutions, and certain fees or loan application fees may be cheaper or even nonexistent.
